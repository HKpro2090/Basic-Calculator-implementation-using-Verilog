# Basic-Calculator-implementation-using-Verilog
The aim of the project is to create a basic calculator which takes two single-digit numbers (each is a single-digit decimal base number entered by user via switches)as input and can perform unsigned addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (only quotient) based on user selection and display the output decimal number (two digits) to the user (sign is displayed for subtraction only).
